## Getting Started

1. Choose the template variation that best suits your needs.
2. Open the corresponding folder (e.g., `elevate/` for the standard template).
3. Edit the `index.html` file to customize content.
4. Modify CSS files to adjust styling as needed.
5. Replace placeholder images in the `img` directory with your own.

## Customization

### Changing Colors

All templates use CSS variables for consistent color management. To change the color scheme:

1. Open the template's main CSS file (e.g., `main.css`, `dark-theme.css`, etc.)
2. Locate the `:root` section at the top of the file
3. Modify the color variables to your preferred values

Example:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #7c4dff;  /* Change to your primary color */
  --secondary-color: #ff4081;  /* Change to your secondary color */
  /* Other color variables */
}
```

### Modifying Sections

Each section in the HTML files is clearly marked with comments. To modify or remove sections:

1. Open the `index.html` file
2. Locate the section you want to modify (e.g., `<!-- Hero Section -->`)
3. Edit the HTML content within that section
4. To remove a section, delete the entire section block

### Adding New Pages

To create additional pages:

1. Copy the `index.html` file to a new file (e.g., `about.html`)
2. Update the page title and content
3. Ensure all navigation links across pages are updated to maintain consistency

## Browser Compatibility

The templates have been tested and are compatible with:

- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance:

1. Compress images before replacing placeholders
2. Minify CSS and JavaScript files for production
3. Consider using a CDN for libraries like Bootstrap and Font Awesome
